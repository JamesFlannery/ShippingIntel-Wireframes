## Technical Architecture

### Presentation Engine
```javascript
class PlatformHub {
  layouts: {
    'market-events': [
      { id: 'featured-ammonia', position: 'position-0-0', size: 'size-2x3' },
      { id: 'market-pulse', position: 'position-0-9', size: 'size-1x1' },
      // ... organized card positioning
    ]
  }
  
  transitionLayout(category) {
    // Fade out → Apply new layout → Staggered fade in
  }
}
```

### Card System
```css
.intel-card {
  /* Self-contained, no-scroll design */
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 12px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.card-title {
  /* Auto-truncating text */
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Grid Layout
```css
.dashboard-cards {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(8, minmax(0, 1fr));
  height: calc(100vh - 60px - 48px);
}
```

- Basic HTML structure with hardcoded content
- Simple authentication flow implementation
- Password: `maritime2024` established

**Phase 2: Authentication & Routing**
- Implemented report-specific authentication (`?report=` parameter)
- Created protected report pages with auth checks
- Built redirect flow: dashboard → auth → report
- Made homepage public, reports protected

**Phase 3: Dashboard Development**
- Created platform hub with category navigation
- Implemented basic card system with manual layouts
- Added Market Events, Technology, Analysis, Regulatory tabs
- Initial card content with maritime intelligence themes

**Phase 4: Presentation Engine**
- Built `PlatformHub` class for intelligent card management
- Implemented category-based layout system with predefined positions
- Added smooth transitions with fade-out/fade-in animations
- Created staggered card entrance effects

**Phase 5: Card System Overhaul**
- Solved overlap issues with proper CSS Grid positioning
- Implemented no-scroll philosophy with content truncation
- Added text clamping with `-webkit-line-clamp`
- Optimized spacing and sizing for viewport constraints

**Phase 6: Content Expansion**
- Added 20+ realistic maritime intelligence cards
- Created variety of card types: Featured, Analytics Widgets, Live Updates

- Added interactive buttons with navigation to detailed reports

### Current Technical Status

**Working Components:**
- ✅ Fixed-height dashboard with no scrolling
- ✅ Category-based card presentation engine
- ✅ Smooth transitions between categories
- ✅ Text truncation and content optimization
- ✅ Interactive card actions with report navigation
- ✅ Authentication flow with report-specific routing
- ✅ YAML-based story rendering for detailed reports

**Architecture Decisions Made:**
- **No-Scroll Cards**: Cards must be self-contained, no scrolling allowed
- **Presentation Engine**: JavaScript manages card layouts and transitions
- **CSS Grid**: 12-column, 8-row grid system for precise positioning
- **Text Truncation**: Content adapts to space constraints with ellipsis
- **Category Organization**: Logical grouping of maritime intelligence

**Key Files & Responsibilities:**
```
index.html                    # Main dashboard entry point
scripts/platform-hub.js       # Presentation engine & card management
styles/platform-hub.css       # Dashboard styling & grid layouts
pages/auth/map.html           # Authentication with report routing
reports/*/                    # Protected report content
scripts/story-renderer.js     # YAML → HTML for detailed reports
```

### Known Issues & Constraints

**Resolved Issues:**
- ❌ Card overlap problems → ✅ Fixed with proper grid positioning
- ❌ Content overflow → ✅ Solved with text truncation
- ❌ Button visibility → ✅ Optimized spacing and layout
- ❌ Category transitions → ✅ Smooth animations implemented

**Current Constraints:**
- Cards must fit within grid cells (no scrolling)
- Text content limited by truncation rules
- Fixed 12x8 grid system for card positioning
- Authentication required for detailed reports

### Development Patterns Established

**Card Creation Pattern:**
1. Add HTML card with unique ID and `data-category`
2. Update JavaScript layout in `PlatformHub.layouts`
3. Assign position class (`position-X-Y`) and size class (`size-XxY`)
4. Ensure content fits within card constraints

**Layout Management:**
- Each category has predefined card positions
- Transitions managed by `transitionLayout()` method
- Staggered animations with 100ms delays
- Cards fade out → reposition → fade in

**Content Guidelines:**
- Titles: 2-line maximum with truncation
- Summaries: 3-line maximum (2 for featured cards)
- Authentic maritime terminology required
- Action buttons for navigation to detailed content

### AI Coding Context

**When working on this project:**
1. **Respect no-scroll philosophy** - Cards must be self-contained
2. **Use presentation engine** - Don't manually position cards
3. **Follow maritime authenticity** - Use proper shipping/trade terminology
4. **Maintain grid system** - 12-column, 8-row CSS Grid layout
5. **Test category transitions** - Ensure smooth animations work
6. **Preserve authentication flow** - Keep report protection intact

**Common Tasks:**
- Adding new cards: Update HTML, JavaScript layouts, ensure content fits
- Modifying layouts: Adjust position classes in `PlatformHub.layouts`
- Content updates: Maintain maritime authenticity and text length limits
- Styling changes: Use existing CSS classes, avoid breaking grid system

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Dashboard loads without scrolling
- [ ] All category tabs switch smoothly
- [ ] Cards display without overlap
- [ ] Text truncates properly
- [ ] Buttons remain visible and functional
- [ ] Authentication flow works for reports
