# Content blocks
content:
  paragraph_1: "Gulf Coast Ammonia Plant (GCA) has executed its inaugural export cargo on Yara's Dancing Brave, loading 1.3M t/y capacity ammonia at Texas City for delivery to Norway (Glomfjord), triggering immediate supply pressure and the fourth consecutive monthly price decline in global ammonia markets."
  
  paragraph_2: "The plant's 1.3M t/y ammonia capacity has created supply concerns in global markets, with Tampa contract prices dropping $25/mt CFR to $435/mt - marking the fourth consecutive monthly decline as markets adapt to additional USG export volumes."
  
  paragraph_3: "Markets are now watching for OCP vessel arrivals and monitoring when the plant reaches full production capacity, with an additional 1.3M tons expected to permanently alter global ammonia trade patterns and establish the USG-Europe trade lane."
  
  paragraph_4: "Industry sources indicate that traditional ammonia suppliers, particularly Trinidad Point Lisas, are reassessing their market positioning as USG exports demonstrate freight advantages to European destinations, with the market settling into a new pricing equilibrium."
